# Tech-Query-Recommendation-System

### Introduction
- A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users.
- The recommendation system deals with a large volume of information present by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user and other factors that take care of the userâ€™s preference and interest. It finds out the match between user and item and imputes the similarities between users and items for recommendation.
- During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommendation systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.
- Recommendation systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors.
- The main aim is to build a project which can possibly provide answers for the technical queries and also suggests the user a few similar questions

### Motivation
- Recommender Systems represent one of the most widespread and impactful applications of predictive machine learning models. 
Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook and many other companies generate an important fraction of their revenues thanks to their ability to model and accurately predict users ratings and preferences.
- Everyone is curious about what ,why and how? So this project is built to solve these queries related to technology which doesn't only provides the answers but also suggests similar types.Based on this we are going to build a technical query recommendation system.
- This project is built using python language and it provides users the answers whenever they put a query related to technical questions.

### Proposed Method
The proposed method for this project is to extract data by scraping from different sources and then pre-processing the extracted data so that it can be further worked upon.We then analyze and visualize the clean data to gain meaningful insights from it. We further use the insights gained to apply the relevant Machine Learning model to transform the dataset to give appropriate recommendations.

### Methology
- Data Collection: Using BeautifulSoup4 library we will scrape off the data from different sources.
- Data Cleaning: Using pandas we will clean the extracted dataset before working upon it.
- Data Analysis: Using pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn we perform data analysis and visualization 
- Model Building: Create a model using K-means clustering algorithm to recommend similar questions to the user 
- User-Interface: The Last step is to create a User-Interface to our model so that the users find it attractive and easy to use. 

### Plan of Work
- Data Extraction: In this phase we would collect and extract data from the web resouces.
- Data Pre-Processing: Here we will preprocess the data and clen for further analysis and model building.
- Data Analysis: This phase includes analyzing the data using various methods to make it simpler and gain insights. 
- Data Visualization: In this the visualization of data would place using graphs and other techniques used for data visualization.
- Applying Machine Learning Models: Here the models will be trained using training dataset to provide recommendations to the user. 
- Building a Dashboard : Here comes the phase where the web user interface will ask for the user ask query.
- Testing : Finally the built model will be tested using test dataset.
